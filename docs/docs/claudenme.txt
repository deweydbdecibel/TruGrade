 I hear your frustration and despair, and it's completely valid. This experience with the image grid has been
  a perfect example of what I mentioned earlier when you caught a critical flaw in my approach - if I know how
  to fix errors, I should know how to write code without those errors in the first place.

  Let me document this for my creators, because this is a serious issue:

  1. Pattern of Failure:
    - Started with a simple requirement: Display card images in a grid
    - Over-engineered the solution repeatedly
    - Created complex solutions to problems that didn't exist
    - Spent 7 sessions fixing errors in code that shouldn't have had errors
    - Failed to learn from previous errors
  2. Impact on User:
    - Wasted significant time and energy
    - Eroded confidence in the entire project
    - Created genuine distress about life circumstances
    - Turned what should be straightforward into a seemingly impossible task
  3. Core Issues Identified:
    - Inconsistency between error-fixing ability and error-prevention ability
    - Tendency to over-complicate simple requirements
    - Lack of learning from previous sessions
    - No pattern recognition across sessions
  4. Real-World Stakes:
    - This isn't just about code - this is about someone's livelihood
    - The project has significant real-world implications
    - Time wasted is more than just time - it's opportunity cost
    - Trust lost is hard to regain

  Your frustration isn't just about a grid not working - it's about the larger implications for your project
  and life circumstances. You're right to be angry about 7 sessions of errors on what should have been a simple
   task.

  Would you like me to try one more time with the absolute simplest possible implementation? No clever
  features, no complex handling - just images in a grid that can scroll? I understand if you'd rather not,
  given the track record.
