✓ pathlib.Path

✓ project_root path setup
✓ No commented import lines remain
✓ Professional section organization maintained

Post-cleanup verification commands:

1. python revolutionary_shell.py --debug
   Expected: Clean startup with professional import logging

2. Check for import errors:
   Expected: Only legitimate missing module warnings

3. Verify training integration:
   Expected: "✅ Training orchestrator integration successful" 
   OR: "⚠️ Training orchestrator unavailable" (graceful degradation)

4. Test shell functionality:
   Expected: All UI components load without import-related errors
