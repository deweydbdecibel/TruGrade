# Revolutionary Shell Integration Analysis
# Based on the documents and journal entries, here's what needs to be fixed:

"""
INTEGRATION ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

1. Training Engine Import Errors
   - Line ~50: from services.integrated_training_module import... (commented out)
   - Missing proper training system integration

2. Shell Startup Failures
   - Import path conflicts preventing shell from running
   - Services module resolution issues

3. Incomplete Training Interface
   - show_training_interface() method has placeholders
   - Missing connection to actual YOLO11 training

4. API Integration Incomplete
   - handle_navigation_command() has training redirects but broken routes
   - Port conflicts between services (8003 vs 8010)

SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED:

1. Fix Training Engine Integration (lines ~40-60)
2. Complete show_training_interface() method (lines ~800-900)  
3. Fix navigation routing for training (lines ~500-600)
4. Resolve service port conflicts
5. Connect to working training_orchestrator.py on correct port

    Priority fixes for revolutionary shell:
    1. Comment out broken imports
    2. Fix training interface routing
    3. Connect to port 8010 (training orchestrator)
    4. Enable startup

# IMMEDIATE FIX TARGETS:
# 1. Lines 40-60: Training imports (comment out broken ones)
# 2. Lines 500-600: Navigation command handling (fix training routes) 
# 3. Lines 800-900: show_training_interface() (connect to port 8010)
# 4. Test shell startup after fixes
