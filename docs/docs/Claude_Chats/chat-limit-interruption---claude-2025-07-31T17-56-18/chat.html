                    <p><br><br>I can see the MCP connection issues in those logs - &quot;Method not found&quot; errors suggest the MCP servers are having trouble with method resolution, likely due to session/connection state getting corrupted when switching chat rooms.<br><br>From your journal and the uploaded files, I can see exactly where we left off! We were working on the **Revolutionary Card Grader** with these key achievements:<br><br>‚úÖ **Operational Systems:**<br>- Photometric stereo engine (0.28s processing, 86.9% surface integrity)<br>- Mobile PWA working with camera access via HTTPS<br>- 4 services running (PWA:5000, Annotation:8000, Training:8001, Augmentation:8002)<br>- Border calibration system with 568 cards calibrated<br><br>‚ùå **Critical Issue We Hit:**<br>The training system was doing **mock training** (2 seconds = impossible for real AI). You correctly identified this and wanted **actual YOLO11 training implementation**.<br><br>üìä **Latest Status:**<br>- 344 images uploaded successfully to training system<br>- Mock &quot;95% accuracy&quot; in 2 seconds (obviously fake)<br>- Stats route hanging due to database blocking operations<br>- Training completed at &quot;epoch 26/100&quot; but meaningless<br><br>üéØ **What I Was About to Implement:**<br>Based on the journal, I had launched research for &quot;real YOLO11 training pipeline to replace 2-second mock&quot; and was working on production-quality border detection training.<br><br>The `safe_dataset_manager.py` you uploaded shows we were building a comprehensive training interface with full user control over dataset selection.<br><br>**MCP Fix:** Try restarting the MCP servers or refreshing the connection. The tools are there but the method resolution is failing.<br><br>Ready to continue with **real YOLO11 training** once MCP stabilizes?</p>

                    <p>I have to add some journal entries.  What I uploaded was the new training system you created.  But reached chat limit.  Most likely I will have to restart PC and then see if the MCP&#039;s are functioning.  Before I come back, I&#039;ll be sure to copy the journal entries from the last 2 chats.  Much has changed.  And yeah.  safe_dataset_manager.py is the last thing we did before we got cut off.  As soon as these MCP work, you will know exactly where we are.  :P  I&#039;ll be right back.</p>
