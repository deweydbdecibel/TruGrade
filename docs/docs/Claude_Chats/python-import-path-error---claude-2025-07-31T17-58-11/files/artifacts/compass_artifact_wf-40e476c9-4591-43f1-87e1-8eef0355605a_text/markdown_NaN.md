# Revolutionary Card Grader Integration Architecture

The Revolutionary Card Grader training system presents a compelling integration challenge: merging the sophisticated training capabilities of a modern orchestrator (port 8010) with the polished visual design of a legacy system (port 8003). This analysis provides a comprehensive technical roadmap for creating a unified platform that maintains visual appeal while delivering advanced functionality.

## Current system architecture reveals critical integration opportunities

The port-based service architecture represents a common pattern in modern ML training systems where **different services handle specialized functions**. The legacy system on port 8003 likely provides the user interface and basic training workflows, while the flexible training orchestrator on port 8010 offers advanced capabilities like dynamic configuration, scalable processing, and sophisticated pipeline management.

**Key architectural differences typically include:**
- **Port 8003 (Legacy)**: Monolithic UI with embedded training logic, limited scalability, but proven user experience patterns
- **Port 8010 (Orchestrator)**: Microservices architecture with API-first design, horizontal scaling capabilities, and advanced training pipeline features

The **Gateway Routing pattern** provides the most effective solution for port consolidation. Using a reverse proxy like Nginx or an API gateway, you can create a unified entry point that routes requests based on functionality while preserving the user experience. This approach enables gradual migration without disrupting existing workflows.

## UI design patterns emphasize component-based modernization

The legacy system's appealing layout likely succeeds through **proven user experience patterns** that should be preserved during integration. Research reveals that effective training interfaces follow these design principles:

**Component-based architecture** using the Atomic Design methodology creates reusable UI elements that can be gradually modernized. The legacy system's visual design can be extracted into a design system with atoms (buttons, inputs), molecules (form groups, search bars), organisms (dashboards, data tables), and templates that maintain consistency while enabling modern functionality.

**Progressive disclosure** ensures complex training capabilities remain accessible without overwhelming users. The legacy UI likely succeeds by showing essential controls first, with advanced orchestrator features accessible through secondary navigation or modal interfaces.

The **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern** provides the ideal bridge between legacy UI components and modern orchestrator capabilities. This creates a dedicated API layer that transforms complex orchestrator responses into the format expected by existing frontend components, enabling seamless integration without UI rewrites.

## Integration strategy balances preservation with modernization

The most effective approach combines **parallel system operation** with **gradual feature migration**. This strategy minimizes risk while enabling continuous improvement:

**Phase 1: Gateway Implementation** establishes unified routing through a reverse proxy that directs traffic between port 8003 and port 8010 based on functionality. This immediately solves navigation routing issues by providing consistent localhost access regardless of underlying service architecture.

**Phase 2: BFF Integration** creates a dedicated backend service that aggregates data from both systems and transforms it for legacy UI consumption. This enables the legacy interface to access advanced orchestrator features without requiring frontend changes.

**Phase 3: Component Modernization** gradually replaces individual UI components with modern equivalents that support advanced features while maintaining visual consistency. The legacy system's design patterns guide this modernization to preserve the appealing user experience.

## Predicted labels workflow requires sophisticated pipeline integration

The predicted labels functionality represents the most complex integration challenge, requiring seamless coordination between AI inference, human review, and model training. The **active learning architecture** provides the technical foundation:

**Confidence-based routing** automatically directs high-confidence predictions to automated labeling while sending uncertain cases to human reviewers. This hybrid approach maximizes efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

**Real-time synchronization** between predicted and ground truth labels uses event-driven architecture to ensure the UI immediately reflects label changes. WebSocket connections enable live updates as predictions are generated or corrected.

**Correction workflow integration** embeds label editing capabilities directly into the training interface, enabling rapid iteration between prediction generation and human refinement. This creates a seamless correction-based training pipeline that improves model performance continuously.

## Visual file management demands sophisticated data handling

The file management system requires **dual-pane interfaces** with thumbnail previews, metadata overlays, and batch operation capabilities. The legacy system's visual appeal likely stems from intuitive file organization patterns that should be preserved.

**Cloud storage integration** using pre-signed URLs enables secure, scalable file uploads while maintaining the responsive interface users expect. The **storage abstraction layer** allows seamless migration between storage backends without UI changes.

**Version control integration** tracks file lineage and enables rollback capabilities, essential for training data management. The **DVC (Data Version Control) pattern** provides proven approaches for managing training datasets with full provenance tracking.

## JSON validation patterns ensure robust error handling

Training session creation errors typically stem from **schema validation failures** and **configuration incompatibilities**. The **Result pattern** provides elegant error handling that preserves user experience while providing actionable feedback.

**Schema-first validation** using JSON Schema ensures consistent data structures across both systems. The **centralized error handling middleware** transforms technical validation errors into user-friendly messages that guide correction.

**Progressive validation** provides real-time feedback as users configure training sessions, preventing errors before submission. This approach significantly improves user experience by eliminating the frustrating cycle of submission failures.

## Navigation routing requires comprehensive architecture overhaul

The routing issues causing all buttons to redirect to localhost:8003 indicate **hardcoded URL patterns** in the legacy system. The solution requires **dynamic routing configuration** that adapts to the unified architecture.

**API Gateway routing** provides path-based request distribution that maintains consistent URLs regardless of backend service. This eliminates hardcoded port references while enabling seamless feature access.

**Frontend routing modernization** using client-side routing libraries ensures navigation remains within the unified application context. The **single-page application (SPA) pattern** provides the most elegant solution for complex training workflows.

## Technical recommendations for immediate implementation

**Start with Gateway Routing** to solve immediate port consolidation needs. An Nginx reverse proxy can provide unified access within days while preserving existing functionality.

**Implement BFF Pattern** to bridge legacy UI and modern orchestrator without requiring frontend rewrites. This creates immediate value while enabling gradual modernization.

**Adopt Component-Based Architecture** to extract the legacy system's appealing design patterns into reusable components. This preserves visual consistency while enabling modern functionality.

**Deploy Event-Driven Architecture** for real-time updates between predicted labels and ground truth corrections. This creates the responsive user experience essential for effective training workflows.

The Revolutionary Card Grader integration represents a sophisticated architectural challenge that requires balancing preservation of proven user experience patterns with modernization capabilities. The strategies outlined provide a practical path forward that minimizes risk while maximizing the value of both systems, creating a unified platform that exceeds the capabilities of either system alone.
