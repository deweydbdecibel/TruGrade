Which means I have to make sure the model has seen them all. I would prefer that I am able to select the images, the labels, etc. It&#039;s just safer.<br>With that being said, I just sent you the above message...You created a new script...but errored right at the end.

                    <p>lol  I was only using those years as an example.  You didn&#039;t have to label them specifically.  That&#039;s sort of what I was saying about the 568.  Sure I have those cards but moving forward, the script is always going to say 568 or those particular years.  Seeing as this will be a long process of scripts and adjustments, just giving me proper sections to do what I need with them is kinda what I was looking for.  Think about it from the perspective of someone who has to create all sorts of models.  I need border models, corner models, edge models, surface defect detectors, and of course we have to be able to somehow incorporate all of that into our main attraction the photometric stereo.  I&#039;m not just thinking about those 568 cards.  I&#039;m thinking about the ones after or how to spread them all out to use them properly to create all of these models.  I liked the option of choosing what I wanted to work on.  But it was missing essential steps like adding photos, or choosing a model that i want to retrain.  What the original section was missing was an advanced ability to really choose and decide.  I like what you are doing but you are sort of paving the way for this one task.  Or using those particular years.  The option to pick is what&#039;s important.  The app doesn&#039;t know what year the cards are and sometimes I choose years all over the place.  Advanced training techniques (2 class option for borders), the ability to add predicted json or text files and the ability to add the corrections so the model can see what it did, and be able to see what was done to correct it.  I love what you have done.  Especially validation and visualization.  But no need to label anything specifically.  Does that make sense?</p>

                    <p>Now you got it!!  Thank you for understanding.  This section is probably one of the most critical as it will be the section that makes or breaks the idea we have.  If the models can&#039;t detect or be accurate, then we are screwed.   And the idea is lost....   I am thinking professionally yet practically.  I&#039;m no genius.  But I know what needs to work and what we will need.  Just not completely sure how to piece it all together.  If it wasn&#039;t for you, this idea of mine would never even have a chance!</p>

Which is good.  Maybe turn the add images section turn into a file explorer like it did before.  Just so I can visually see that they are there.  And then above it, still have a button that allows me to add more images, and maybe a button that allows me to remove some if they have been selected.  As for the model predictions and corrections sections.  Same thing.  obviously they can be alittle smaller as they are just text files and only need so much room.  But, I don&#039;t know if they loaded or not.  No confirmation and up in the corner it says labels 0.  I don&#039;t wanna sound picky at all but at the same time, I want everything to work and be well next level.

                    <p>🔧 **Found the bug!** File ID mismatch between singular/plural forms. Let me fix this:</p>
<p>Let me also add debugging to the refresh function:</p>
<p>✅ **Fixed the file ID mismatch! Restart the server:**<br><br>```bash<br># Stop current server (Ctrl+C)<br>python services/advanced_training_platform.py<br>```<br><br>**🔧 What I fixed:**<br>- **File ID mismatch** - Was looking for `prediction-files` but expecting `predictions-files`<br>- **Added debugging** - Console logs will show exactly what&#039;s happening<br>- **Consistent naming** - All file IDs now match the JavaScript<br><br>**🔍 Now when you upload predictions/corrections:**<br>1. **Open browser console** (F12) to see debug messages<br>2. **Upload files** - you&#039;ll see upload progress in console<br>3. **Check if files appear** in the visual browsers<br><br>**📱 If still not working, the console will show:**<br>- &quot;Uploading X files for predictions&quot;<br>- Upload result with file details<br>- Refresh results showing file counts<br><br>**🚀 Try the workflow again:**<br>1. Create session (Border Detection + Prediction/Correction)<br>2. Upload your prediction text files<br>3. Upload your correction text files  <br>4. Check console (F12) for any error messages<br><br>**The console logs will tell us exactly where the issue is if it&#039;s still not working!**<br><br>Ready to test with the fixed file handling?</p>

                    <p>ok.  correct the redundant option in the training menu, and then, we need to connect it to our shell.  Of course we need to know if everything is working first but, having it attached to the app is important too.</p>
