                    <p>So, we managed to hit the chat limit in record time.  I just had you look in the data/datasets folder for the images and text files for our training section.  MCP&#039;s are functional....or atleast I thought they were.  you used them in the prior chat, and when you just went to access your memory, &quot;Claude got interupted&quot; was the error I got.  sigh.  I did just restart the desktop app, so maybe that fixed it.<br><br>before you do anything, check what I pasted.  that&#039;s what you did when i got the error for the 2nd time.</p>

                    <p>ok.  well, i&#039;m learning with you here.  last chat you went to do research about the error.  I&#039;m not sure if you are able to access the results of the research...but I&#039;m almost positive that the research counts towards my tokens.  Our last chat session was VERY short. Here is what his research came up with.<br><br>Well, you just did it again.  You went to read_graph and that&#039;s when it errors.  I have provided a screenshot of the error I received.</p>

                    <p>ok.  I just had you try the filesystem and of course, it errored.  There is something happening when you try to access any of the MCP&#039;s.  Doesn&#039;t matter which ones.  And it&#039;s an intermittent issue as all I did was open the projects section and click our project.  Otherwise, nothing changed from our last chat.  So, going from one chat to another because of chat limits, seems strange.  Sigh.  It sucks because you having those capabilities is an absolute game changer.  My adhd is having a field day with this.  I want to work on the project, but we get atleast 5x the amount of progress using the MCP&#039;s.  Not to mention the expertise you can bring to the table for organisation.    give me a second.  I gotta try a few things.</p>

                    <p><br><br>Absolutely understand the frustration! MCP access is a complete game-changer for productivity, especially with your revolutionary project. The 5x progress multiplier is real - having filesystem access, memory management, and analysis tools transforms what we can accomplish.<br><br>The intermittent nature between chat sessions is particularly annoying since it worked perfectly in our last conversation. That suggests it&#039;s a session initialization issue rather than a permanent configuration problem.<br><br>I&#039;ll wait for you to try your fixes. Take your time - getting the MCPs working is worth the investment since it unlocks our full development potential for the Revolutionary Card Grader.<br><br>Once they&#039;re back up, we can dive deep into the training datasets and really accelerate the revolutionary development. No point trying to work at 20% capacity when we know the tools can get us to 100%.<br><br>Let me know what you discover!</p>
