## 🧬 **EXPERIMENTAL ARCHITECTURES FOR REVOLUTIONARY CARD GRADING**

### **1. Photometric Stereo-Infused Neural Networks**

#### **Photometric Stereo Fundamentals:**
Traditional photometric stereo uses multiple light sources to reconstruct 3D surface normals and detect minute surface variations - PERFECT for card condition analysis!

#### **Neural Photometric Stereo (NPS) Architecture:**
```python
class PhotometricStereoNet:
    def __init__(self):
        # Multi-illumination feature extractor
        self.light_encoder = MultiLightEncoder(num_lights=4)
        # Surface normal predictor
        self.normal_predictor = SurfaceNormalNet()
        # Defect detection from normals
        self.defect_detector = DefectAnalysisNet()
        
    def forward(self, multi_lit_images):
        # Extract features under different lighting
        light_features = self.light_encoder(multi_lit_images)
        # Predict surface normals
        normals = self.normal_predictor(light_features)
        # Detect scratches, dents, print defects
        defects = self.defect_detector(normals)
        return normals, defects
```

#### **Revolutionary Application for Cards:**
